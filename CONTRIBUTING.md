## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [project maintainer's email].

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Facadedevil/Edge_AI_Container.git
   ```
3. Add upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Facadedevil/Edge_AI_Container.git
   ```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support or Jetson device
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- Python 3.9 or higher

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Build the development container:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add some feature"
   ```

3. Keep your branch updated:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Submit a Pull Request

### Pull Request Requirements
- Update documentation as needed
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes
- Follow coding standards
- Include relevant issue numbers
- Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints
- Document functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
